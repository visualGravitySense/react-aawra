# Beauty Courses Project

This project is a React application designed to list and showcase beauty courses from various salons. The design is inspired by modern, minimalist aesthetics with a focus on user-friendly navigation and clean UI.

## Project Structure

The project is built with React, Vite, and Bootstrap for the front-end, utilizing JSONPlaceholder for demo content such as course images and instructor details.

### Technologies Used
- **React**: Front-end framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Build tool that allows fast development.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive, mobile-first design.
- **JSONPlaceholder**: Fake REST API for testing and prototyping.

## Project Plan

### 1. Setup and Initial Configuration

- Initialize the project with Vite and React.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap
  ```

- Create the folder structure:
  ```
  src/
    components/
      HeroSection.jsx
      FeaturedCourses.jsx
      CategorySection.jsx
      Testimonials.jsx
    pages/
      Home.jsx
    assets/
  ```

### 2. Design Components

- **Hero Section**: Design the landing section with a large image, headline, and call-to-action button.
- **Featured Courses**: Display a grid of beauty courses, fetched from JSONPlaceholder, with images, titles, and instructor names.
- **Category Section**: A list of categories for the beauty courses, each represented with a button.
- **Testimonials Section**: Display student reviews with a small photo, name, and course feedback.

### 3. Fetching Data

- Fetch images and course descriptions using `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos`.
- Fetch instructor and testimonial data using `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.

### 4. UI/UX Design

- Implement a clean, modern aesthetic inspired by beauty and wellness industries.
- Use Bootstrap for responsive layout and styling.
- Add icons and hover effects for better user interaction.

### 5. Final Touches

- Add navigation links to different course categories.
- Implement dark mode support using React context.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
